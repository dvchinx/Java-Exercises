<h2>INTERMEDIATE -> EXERCISE 1</h2>

**CREATION OF A BASIC CALCULATOR:**.

1- Implement in console a listing with the following options:

* Add.

* Subtract.

* Multiply.
 
* Divide.

* Exit *-System.exit(0)-*.

2- Create for each of the operations: 
* A class with its respective constructor and variables *float:(val1, val2)*.

* Method that performs the required operation *returning* the result as *int:(result)*.

* Inherit the attributes and methods of the required class in the *main* method.

3- Make use of *try/catch* for possible user input errors:

* Enter an index that is not registered in the list.

* Entering values that are not expected when performing operations.

*Take into account:* 

* *Give the approximate result using the Math.round(float) method.*
* *Mandatory use of inherited methods and polymorphism.*
* *Code clean, well-structured and optional: commented out.*

<h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>.

**Console:**

```
===================
 Choose an option:
===================
1. Add.
2. Subtract.
3. Multiply.
4. Dividing.
5. Exit.
-> 3
Enter First Value: 4,2
Enter Second Value: 3
The Approximate Result of the Multiplication is: 13
```
