<h2>INTERMEDIATE -> EXERCISE 3</h2>

**CALCULATE A NUMBER IN THE FIBONACCI SERIES:**

*Fibonacci series: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...* 
*(The sum of one term with the previous one gives the next term)*

1- Receive input from the user with the library *Java.Util.Scanner*.

2- Create a *method:(Fibonacci)* that receives an *int:(number)* and returns an *int*.

3- User input must be stored as *int:(number)*.

4- Make unique use of *if statement* and *recursion*.

*Take into account:*
* *The integer to return is the number found in the position entered by the user.*

<h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>

Fibonacci of 4 is 3.
```

**Explanation:**

The Fibonacci sequence number found at position **4** is: **3**.
