<h2>BASIC -> EXERCISE 5</h2>

**CALCULATE THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR:**.

1- Receive user input with the *Java.Util.Scanner* library.

2- User input should be stored as *int:(a,b)*.

3- The result printed by console must be *int:(result)*.

4- Create a *method:(calcMCD)* that receives *int:(a, b)* and returns the result.

*Take into account:*
* *Use the Euclides algorithm to calculate the DCM.*

<h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>

**Console:**

```
-Calculate Common Greatest Divisor of Two Numbers-

Enter the first value: 270
Enter the second value: 93
The DCM of 270 and 93 is: 3
