<h2>BASIC -> EXERCISE 6</h2>

**CHECK IF A STRING IS A PALINDROME OR NOT:**

1- Receive user input with the *Java.Util.Scanner* library.

2- The user input must be stored as *String:(originalString)*.

4- Create a *method:(isPalindrome)* that receives a *String:(str)* and returns a *boolean*.

*Take into account:*
* *A Palindrome is that string which reads the same backwards.*

<h2>Example:</h2>

**Console:**

```
-Check if the String is Palindrome-.

Enter string: Borrow or Rob
'Borrow or Rob': is a palindrome.
```
