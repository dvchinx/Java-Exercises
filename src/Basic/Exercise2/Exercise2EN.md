<h2>BASIC -> EXERCISE 2</h2>

**CALCULATE THE AREA OF A TRIANGLE:**

**Formula: Base * Height / 2**

1- Receive user input with library *Java.Util.Scanner*.

2- User entries should be stored as *float:(base, height)*

3- Store '2' as a constant integer variable *(int final)*.

4- The result printed by console should be given approximately as *int:(area)*.

*Note: To give the approximate result using the method Math.round(float).*

<h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>

**Console**

```
Enter the value of the base (can be decimal):
2,4

Enter the value of the height:
3

The approximate area of the triangle is: 4
```
